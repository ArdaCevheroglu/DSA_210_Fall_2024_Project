Analysis of Caffeine's Effects on Money Spending Trends


Project Overview


This project aims to discover the relationship between caffeine consumption and spending habits. By analyzing my personal data that I collected over a specific time frame, I aim to discover patterns and trends that might indicate whether or not caffeine consumption has a significant impact on my spending behavior. The findings of this project could provide insights into behavioral economics and personal finance management.


Motivation


Caffeine is a part of my daily routine, and I often consume it before studying, attending lectures, or for every other possible reason there exists. However, I recently noticed that I tend to make more purchases, after having more coffee than I normally do on a daily basis. This project is an opportunity to explore whether caffeine genuinely affects my spending behavior and how this relationship can be explained.


Dataset Description


The dataset for this project will be entirely self-collected. I will extract the necessary data from Google Calendar and Akbank mobile app and also over the next four weeks, I will log the following metrics daily:

1. Caffeine Consumption Data

Caffeine intake: Amount of caffeine consumed throughout the day (in the form of milligrams) and the time of consumption.

Other factors: Significant events that might affect results (exam / homework deadlines and other day to day events).

2. Spending Data

Money spent: Summary of expenses categorized by type (food, clothing, electronic devices, accessories, gifts and others).

Other significant factors: Events that might affect results (birthdays, holidays and other special occasions where people tend to spend more money)


Data Analysis Plan


1. Data Collection

Caffeine consumption data will be extracted from Google Calendar mobile app and logged to a simple spreadsheet for backup.

Spending data will be extracted from Akbank mobile app and also logged to a simple spreadsheet for backup.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Clean and preprocess the dataset.

Perform EDA to identify trends and correlations (caffeine intake vs. spending trends).

3. Visualization

Visualize correlations between caffeine intake and spending habits using heatmaps, scatterplots, and other graphs.

4. Machine Learning Models

Build a regression model to predict daily spending trends based on caffeine intake.

Use clustering to group days with similar caffeine intakes and classify whether high spending days are caffeine-influenced.

5. Reporting Findings and Presentation

Compile findings into a concise report.

Create a project website, video or slide summarizing results.


Techniques and Tools


Data Collection: Manual tracking using apps and spreadsheets.

Data Analysis: Python with Pandas, NumPy and other libraries.

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other libraries for interactive dashboards.

GitHub for hosting scripts and the project repository.


Findings


Although findings will emerge from the analysis, I look forward to discovering:

Whether caffeine consumption correlates with spending habits.

Possible time based patterns (morning coffee leading to higher amount of money spent during noon time etc.).


Limitations and Future Work


Limitations


Sample size: The project is limited to my personal data. Generalizing findings requires more participants.

Data accuracy: Self-reported and app-recorded caffeine consumption and spending trends may have inconsistencies.

Confounding Variables: Other factors like mood, holidays, and social plans could affect spending beyond caffeine's influence.


Future Work


Suggest improvements, like expanding the study  to include more participants in the future since not everyone reacts to external stimuli like caffeine in the same way.
